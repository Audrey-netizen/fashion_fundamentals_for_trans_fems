## Section 1: Colour

I wish I didn‚Äôt have to do this, but really this guide needs to start with 
absolute basics, because good lord I have seen some bad combos from femmes in 
social circles public online etc. A colour is just a colour (duh), but almost 
all outfits use 2+ colours, so yknow we have to have some guidelines as to how
to make combos work. This is usually just for logistic reasons, people don‚Äôt 
want a wardrobe of one colour, and they don‚Äôt want to just wear their clothes in
the same combination, so items and thus colours get mixed and matched.

With that said, I will go against these statements/wants for the first piece of
advice: just buy black. When I say colour yeah that includes black and white and
greys, but anyways why is the advice ‚Äújust buy black‚Äù and not any other colour?
Well, black is overall for the most clothing articles and fashion niches and 
bodies, by far the most universally ‚Äúgood‚Äù/aesthetically pleasing colour. As in,
it‚Äôs very hard to fuck up. For the vast majority people, the exception to the 
outfits using 2+ colours rule is all-black. Technically this can be done with 
other colours as well, but it is exceedingly rare and not something I‚Äôd 
recommend to anyone new to fashion.

Black is also hard to fuck up because of its synergy with other colours. Black
is the only colour that works with literally any other colour, including itself,
except arguably dark navy blue but even then I think it can work it‚Äôs just a bit
tricky. These two factors skyrocket the versatility of black as colour compared
to any other, and versatility means more uses which means a more efficient 
purchase of an item (aka budget-friendly). If you are looking to buy say a 
cableknit sweater and you do not have one in black, the ‚Äúlogical‚Äù choice is to 
buy it in black over whatever other colour(s) you were also looking at. There
can be a threshold of having so much black in your wardrobe that the "logical"
choice is no longer black, but I am assuming that the target audience of this
guide is not particularly close to that. Without exaggeration, this can apply to
basically any article of clothing, and even more so accessories. After the 
metallic silvers and golds (obviously), by far the most common colour for 
accessories/jewelry is black, that‚Äôs not a coincidence. Since black goes with 
pretty much every colour, the black accessories can go with a lot more outfits.

If that sounds boring, to have so much black in one‚Äôs wardrobe, well yeah it is.
It‚Äôs not like my entire wardrobe is pretty much all black, but it's comfortably
the most dominant visual component of my closet. The only colour which can 
actually get away with a whole ass wardrobe consisting of that one colour is you
guessed it black, with a goth wardrobe (will note that an absolute all black 
gothwardrobe is rare, but the point is it‚Äôs possible). I‚Äôm obviously not telling
everyone to get a goth wardrobe (as cute as goth girls are üòî), the point is 
that if you‚Äôre absolutely clueless about colour as a fashion concept, black is 
the hardest one to mess up. So this is the most absolute basic lesson.

But for the people who want more variety in their wardrobe, we can move on to 
other colours. Well sort of, first let‚Äôs cover white and grey. White is‚Ä¶ good, 
but yknow it gets dirty. And that‚Äôs a big deal when/if we‚Äôre doing a whole-ass 
fashion overhaul, buying an item that will get dirty quickly is an awful idea 
financially. Different items and fabrics get dirty at different rates though, 
and can be cleaned at differing effectiveness. The main factors that play a role
here are the article of clothing, and the material of the item. Pants and shoes
will receive more contact with external environment than a top which will mostly
be covered with another layer, or a purse or a sweater. But also, especially in
the case of shoes their material will greatly affect how good their longevity
is, fabric is the hardest to clean, leather is complicated, faux leather is 
quite forgiving, and stuff like soles and other hard plasticky stuff are super
easy. So, fabric shoes and pants bad, other stuff is manageable. Keep in mind
though how badly your body sweats is as a factor here, hopefully you already
know this from having worn white shirts before. Overall while white is a very
versatile colour, it‚Äôs functionally the hardest to maintain of any. If you can
identity what sort of items you wouldn‚Äôt be at big risk of dirtying though, go
for it! There is also a look that can be cultivated from beat down/dirtied white
pieces, but I will assume that you‚Äôre not at that level yet and this is probably
a bad idea. Dirty white clothes probably = slobby look.

Grey is cool, I like grey. Lighter shades are kinda like white but with way less
noticeable dirtying issues. Meanwhile dark grey is very much its own colour and
I‚Äôd argue an extremely useful and versatile one. And neutral grey is cool too!
At a certain point you might notice the presence of black on an outfit might be
‚Äútoo much‚Äù to you or for the setting (more on this later), here dark grey is 
ideal to well bring a dark base to your outfit. Together, black whites and greys
despite maybe seeming boring are a very easy to follow baseline. I said before
that the ‚Äúlogical choice‚Äù when buying an item is to just get it in black, but 
that‚Äôs in a vacuum. If you have ‚Äútoo much‚Äù of black items the new purchase will
have a hard time standing out in your wardrobe and outfits. What that ‚Äútoo much‚Äù
is is ultimately for you to find out since it‚Äôs not some easy ratio I can just
hand out, it‚Äôs based on personal and local preferences. But the point is once
that too much is reached, getting other items in the whites and greys avert this
issue while still being foundational in the sense that they go with most other
colours and perhaps more importantly work with the other black/white/greys. 
Similarly to how someone could hypothetically straight up have an all-black 
wardrobe, an ‚Äúall-shades‚Äù wardrobe is also technically possible. If you want to
venture past this point it‚Äôs really up you, but most people do since colours are
pretty fun!

Past this point, colour stops being so convenient. For example, the shade of 
blue used in medium wash denim* is more useful/versatile than all shades of 
yellow combined. Why? We live in a society lol, but also because our own bodies
have a complex colour set up. This is a topic I‚Äôd want to mostly leave for level
3, but to put it briefly, since we have different skin colours and undertones, 
different colours work for different people. 

[GIGANTIC DISCLAIMER INCOMING] This topic of skin undertones and complexion is
pretty loaded, and I think it‚Äôs easy to not only make allegations of but notice
outright white defaultism/racism in many resources regarding this topic. 
Firstly, undertone and skin tone are not equal, skin tone changes depending on 
sunlight exposure but undertone stays the same(?). Second, some people got skin 
colour that‚Äôs either too dark to clearly ID or even see enough vein colour stuff
and other tests for undertone. Third, a lot of media out there for this colours
that match undertone stuff uses white/european ethnicity women to demonstrate
these differences. So like, we live in a society. But also, undertone is just a
way of simplifying what colours work well for some people both for their own 
usage and in conversations with others as a topic. Personally I don‚Äôt have a 
‚Äúconvenient undertone‚Äù, like when I've gotten laser hair removal before my
technician swapped between different versions of lasering cuz some areas fall
under "lighter skin" and others for whatever is the next category darker from
that, do a lot of finding what colours work well on me was trial and error. 
Lastly it is worth noting that deliberately ignoring what colours work better on
oneself is its own form of fashion expression. You can do it if you want as with
most things in the fashion but with someone not trying to break the mold too 
much it‚Äôs just not necessary and a lot easier to just stick to colours that work
best with you instead. Or you can not be after breaking the mold but just see an
item you think is cool even if it‚Äôs not a colour you‚Äôd say fits you well, but 
fuck it we getting that item, that‚Äôs also valid :)

Again the focus right now isn‚Äôt really on these personalized topics, but to just
make sure everyone is aware of them. But basically the reason why these 
distinctions matter and why blue is so much more versatile than yellow is due to
how once we move past black white and grey, colours have other colours they do
not work with as well or flat out not at all. That medium wash denim shade of 
blue works better overall and with a bigger variety of human colours than 
yellows.

Luckily, it‚Äôs not too hard to figure out what colours work well or not so well
or just ok with you. Simply go to a store and try on clothes in differing 
colours, or even just see them beside you in a mirror. If you feel uncomfortable
with presenting femme in a clothing store atm, well remember we don‚Äôt care about
the items here we just care about the colours, so you can just as easily boymode
and look at the men‚Äôs section of clothes if that‚Äôs easier for you atm. I also 
feel like it‚Äôs important to state here, if you don‚Äôt care about how certain 
colours work with your complexities. Personally I‚Äôm pretty fortunate with my 
complexion/undertone here, as out of the conventional categories I‚Äôm closest to
a combination/neutral undertone, meaning I can get away with a good variety of 
colours and intensity/brightness of said colours. But pale pink and yellows 
still look less flattering on me (like I genuinely look sick with them by me), 
sometimes though I just want to wear trans pastel pink so fuck it we ball. All 
of these suggestions are just that, suggestions, not mandatory. The point is, I
just want it to all be in one place in a context considering the position of 
trans fem.

Anyways, why is blue so versatile anyways? Well, most people‚Äôs skin colour and
undertone have some combination of yellow pink and brown, and as it turns out 
blue contrasts with all of these pretty smoothly. Our skin colour/undertone is
very complex unique and changing thanks to sunlight, but blue kinda just 
consistently contrasts this huge net fairly well. I didn‚Äôt mention this 
explicitly before but the blacks and whites and greys also work with our skin
complexion. What specific type of blue works then? Well it‚Äôs up to you, there‚Äôs
also the idea of darker blues being more fitting with colder/darker climates and
days and lighter blues working in warmer/sunnier settings. So here we go with: 

## Section 2: Seasonality

Have a different set of colours fit for each season? That sounds pretty stupid,
I don‚Äôt wanna buy an article of clothing for 4 months. Or what if I live in a 
place without the convenient northern temperate 4 month seasons? Well yeah 
that‚Äôs fair, but let‚Äôs break it down to a basic level. If it‚Äôs 35 degrees 
(Celsius, idgaf if this is probably a majority American sub suck on my teets), 
you can‚Äôt really wear more than one layer and underwear without sweating a ton 
and risking getting closer to heatstroke. Likewise if there‚Äôs 10cm of snow 
everywhere, you kinda need to wear boots because A: don‚Äôt get the less rugged 
non-boot shoes wet and salt tainted and B: your toesies are gonna get too cold 
in normal sneakers or sandals. To put it briefly, colder weather = more layers,
more rugged pieces of clothing. Rainy days = an umbrella or waterproof top (or 
you just walk in and out of your car every day and slowly but surely creep into 
despair as you further realize how insane and dystopian car dependency is but 
hey at least you don‚Äôt have to think about the daily weather as much for your 
outfits üëç). If it‚Äôs very sunny, black will heat you up more because science 
(the only true weakness of black as a colour, besides staining from bad 
deodorant and winter road salts).

So there‚Äôs some functionality here, but what does that have to do with the 
colours I wear? Besides the brief mention of more sun = darker shades make you 
feel more hot, you can argue that those necessary clothing differences led to 
ideas of what other pieces lead to a cohesive outfit with them. If it‚Äôs cold and
you need to put on a pea coat* or parka*, it kinda dictates what else you can 
wear with it. This is a bit more complex but either thicker fabrics or super 
thin and body conforming ones like seen in leggings and bodysuits work better 
here, we‚Äôre either going with a cut of clothing strong enough to not get muted
out by how hefty our coat is, or going the opposite end and creating a contrast.
There is also a hidden third option in women's clothing where there are some 
thinner pea coats and the like that enable more in-between intensity of fabrics
to be worn with them, but that's for later.

But what does this have to do with colour? Well, seasons also change the literal
colour composition outside. Might sound simple enough but I think explanation is
helpful here. If you have fall where you live, those shades of brown and orange
(technically the same colour btw) and yellow and red from the leaves are going 
to suit stuff like navy blue and maroon red and olive green and browns more so 
than bright colours, the contrast will be too much. If you‚Äôre an urbanite, 
winter will probably involve lots of greys and whites, unsurprisingly the OP 
trio of black white grey are even more useful here but there‚Äôs also an 
opportunity for bright colours to stand out since the muted background let 
something like a bright red or purple or blue or whatever works for your body 
stand out without much conflict. Summer and spring time, or just the dry season
in equatorial regions, are bright and green and maybe flowery too. Now strong
colours can work well but mostly those which don‚Äôt contrast too much with the
current set of dominant colours in nature. Regardless of where you live the sky
is gonna be either some shade of blue or grey or both at daytime, that‚Äôs 
something to consider too. The actual brightness/daily sun hours of the season
and how cloudy each day is also changes how synergistic each colour and shade of
said colour is.

Sound complex? That‚Äôs because it is. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to be following these
synergies super strongly, neither do I. But it‚Äôs something to keep in mind. 
Seasonality might sound like a made up term for the clothing industry to make
more money and they definitely do play into it harder to have more profits, but
it‚Äôs ultimately established in reality. Think about where you live, what the
current season literally feels and looks like, and the same for other season(s)
throughout the year. Seasons can be extremely different depending on where in
the world one is, and how seasons affect one‚Äôs wardrobe depends on how urbanized
the region they call home is, and how they get around. So it‚Äôs very
personalized, I can‚Äôt get into specifics without making a gigantic guide on its
own, this is to serve as a basic introduction and reference point. Fashion is
not a science, so at some point you gotta get a feel for seasonality and all
these topics in general, but I hope this helps.

Section 3: Colour cont.

Ok well what about everything that‚Äôs not black white grey and blue? Good
question, I‚Äôll keep overviews of other colours/shades of them pretty brief
because it starts to get fairly personalized based on one‚Äôs complexion from here
onwards. Brown is probably the next one to go over. Brown has a functional
reason for historically existing in fashion due to leather, various treatments
of leather turn out into shades of brown. If you don‚Äôt want to support/purchase
animal-based clothing products, this functional reason goes away. But still,
brown is pretty useful because it can be similar to our own skin tone. You don‚Äôt
want it to be the exact same, but having varying shades/brightness of the same
colour (in this case brown) can be pretty effective on an outfit. Figure out
what works for you from trying out different types of brown in a store, try to
wear black/white/grey for the outfit you wear to the store so you can focus more
on the brown rather than how it works with both your skin and whatever other
colour you‚Äôre wearing. With all that said, I'm a brown hater, I don't have much
brown going on in my wardrobe. Competent use of brown comes associated with a
certain level of maturity/groundedness that I personally don't want to associate
as much with, might sound complex because it is but that's just me. The point is
that these sections on colour are for giving you context and guidelines (but
seriously plz follow the part on black and greys if you're new to this stuff).

Ok that‚Äôs five, what next? Red and green probably. The ‚Äúsafe‚Äù varieties of these
two are the aforementioned maroon red and olive green. They‚Äôre the most common
shades you‚Äôll see in stores and for good reason. For most skin complexions, they
will work out (however some people are pale/cool enough that these two will wash
them out, again test for yourself), and as a broader set, blue brown red and 
green are not in much contrast with each other in these shades. That‚Äôs not to 
say throw all of these into one outfit, but maroon red works pretty well with 
navy blue, olive green works pretty well with that sort of washed out pale blue,
both work well with most browns , olive green and maroon red can work with each
other fairly well, you get the idea I hope. I‚Äôll briefly mention that ‚Äúhow many
colours can I competently wear in one outfit‚Äù is again a feel-based thing. But a
general concept to consider is that the further and further down the list of 
colours we go here, the less you can pair other colours with it in one outfit.
Past this point, unless you‚Äôre pretty advanced with fashion sense, the following
colours kinda need to be thought of as the star/protagonist of your outfit.

Let‚Äôs re-explore blue red and green. Strong vibrant brighter shades of these
three colours naturally draw the eye towards them, if you have two colours of 
this intensity together it literally splits the viewer across an outfit, it‚Äôs 
harder to be cohesive. For some examples, think of a red cocktail dress*, the 
most common way I imagine of using this item in a cohesive outfit is black 
accessorization and shoes/bag. That‚Äôs how much attention making your top and 
bottom red does, you can ‚Äúonly get away with‚Äù having accessories in the most 
universal colour available. Obviously you don‚Äôt have to follow this rule 
whenever you wear a bright red dress, but it‚Äôs important to consider why a 
bright red dress outfit often plays out this way when most wear it. For bright
blue and green, imma be real these two colours are pretty niche. It might sound
surprising considering what I said about blue previously, but an intense type of
blue actually gets to the point of overpowering many skin shades/undertones, 
defeating the original reason I gave as to blue being versatile. A more muted 
blue compliments most bodies well, a navy blue can sort of fill the role of 
black in its absence, and bright blue works best for that small minority of 
people where a muted blue doesn‚Äôt work too well with their complexion. That‚Äôs 
not to say strong blues can‚Äôt work in an outfit any individual shade of a colour
can, but it‚Äôs just not nearly as versatile as the other types of blue. Unless
you are a particularly pale/pink undertone individual, in which case this bright
highly saturated blue is a fantastically pleasing colour for your setup. Now for
green, a high-saturation green, especially a darker shade of high-saturation 
green, is from my experience one of the most unnatural and rare colours we see 
in fashion. Again, not to say it can‚Äôt work, but this type of green is in 
possibly the weirdest space of all colour niches where it‚Äôs too strong to be an
inoffensive/easily synergistic colour, but also not even a strong enough 
contrast compared to high saturation shades of blue red pink purple yellow 
orange for instances where you want a powerful burst of vibrance in an outfit. 
It can be done, but for a beginner I would strongly recommend staying away from
this type of green‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just really weird. Unless you are fairly darker with
your complexion, in which case bright saturated green can look mesmerizing.
Pale red and green were not mentioned yet. Pale red is arguably also just
pale pink which is mentioned in the next paragraph. Pale green is that sort of 
mint green. This colour is cool, I like it. Takes some finesse to figure out 
though. Somewhere here teal should also be mentioned, since it lies somewhere
between high saturation of blue and green. Again, cool colour but takes some 
finesse to figure out. From my experience and seeing it in others, works
fantastic on people with "olive skin complexions" ie middle eastern 
mediterranean These latter three (pale red, pale green, teal) are easier to use
than the high saturation trio mentioned, but do not work on as many different
skin complexions and undertones as navy blue maroon red and olive green do.

Ok so those other basic colours, yellow orange purple pink, where do they fit
in? Well you can just argue pink and orange to be different shades/saturations
of red and brown respectively, which is objectively true but it stops being as
effective in practice when we think about these two pairs in high saturation.
Highly saturated pink like a hot pink or magenta is completely different from 
the aforementioned bright red. This one is tricky to use, it‚Äôs pretty popular in
certain fashion subcultures/groups (more on this in a later section) as a 
dominant colour, but generally speaking adults use a strong saturation pink as a
minor contrast piece. This is recommended. The same can be said for highly 
saturated orange. Pastel/heavily muted shades of pink and orange are pretty 
interesting. ‚ÄúPastel orange‚Äù is basically just a type of lighter brown seen with
some cures of leather but rarely more "distinctly orange in some items", and
pastel pink is well the thingy on the trans flag, or salmon or whatever you 
wanna call it. These two are pretty innoffensive, but it‚Äôs important to consider
your own skin complexion here. Depending on undertone these two can just wash 
into your skin, identify if this is the case for you. If so, I would generally
advise staying away from them as a beginner, but with enough understanding they
can work out well enough and as always you can just not care about this advice.

Yellow and purple are the final pair of colours left, and it shouldn‚Äôt be 
surprising since they‚Äôre opposite colours but their roles are pretty different. 
Well except high saturation, the sort of super bright yellow and purple again 
are things which should be reserved for small pops of colour when starting out. 
In more moderate and washed out shades, or alternatively deeper ones (think of 
how maroon navy and olive green are)‚Ä¶ generally the person who can rock purple 
well cannot rock yellow too well and vice versa. I‚Äôm in the camp where purple 
looks pretty pleasant on me, yellow washes me out (yellow and types of red more
called pink are the two broad colours I try to stay away from as someone with a
neutral/combination undertone and a complexion/skin colour that‚Äôs generally 
something like lightly to moderately melanated). Yellow and purple are pretty 
rarely seen, just think about the people you see every day, their outfits are 
much less likely to have one of these two basic colours compared to red green 
blue and orange/brown let alone black/white/grey. Since it‚Äôs effectively a 
coinflip which of these two basic colours work well for you as an individual, 
stores have less items in purple/yellow since it caters to less people. Many 
people also can‚Äôt be bothered to figure out undertone stuff. But again, at least
one of these two should work well on your complexion/undertone, try them at 
stores (ideally like a store that sells a bunch of different colour basic 
tshirts ie Uniqlo) and figure out which looks better/easier on you. This is not
a universal rule however, for example bright highly saturated yellow and purple
can look great on the same time of darker complexion person whom bright green
pops with, and more muted/pastel yellow and purple work with someone who would
still be considered to have a darker complexion but perhaps a notch or two down.

Once this basic colour journey is done, you should have a sort of palette to 
follow. Within different colours there are many minute synergies about ie just
what shade of red and blue work best for different undertones, but this gets 
into level 3. The key takeaways are that:
  Black is the best. You can just stop and have an entirely black wardrobe if 
  you want to, and can likewise stop at whatever number and the colours in 
  previous numbers added together.
  White is close, but that‚Äôs even without taking into account its shelf life.
  Grey is a strong third place, but because we get into different shades and 
  intensities now this needs to be taken into account as well.
  Blue in its more palatable varieties is the most versatile of the ‚Äúactual 
  colours‚Äù since it contrasts smoothly with your literal skin and pairs smoothly
  with the literal sky.
  Brown/orange kinda does the opposite effect of possibly pairing smoothly with
  your skin and contrasting well with the sky, but it takes added finesse to 
  figure out what varieties of it works best with your specific skin 
  complexion/undertone. 
  Now that we‚Äôre are 5, gotta be careful to not throw in
  too many colours at once.
  More palatable varieties of red and green are next in versatility, most 
  notably maroon red and olive green. But starting from here onwards, it‚Äôs 
  possible that your complexion and undertone visually reject maroon red and 
  olive green, it‚Äôs just statistically more rare. Figure it out for yourself if 
  it works on you or not starting from here and following numbers.
  Stronger varieties of blue red and green are where we start to get into 
  colours that either need to be a focal point of an outfit or small bursts of
  vibrance unless you wanna risk outfit colour coordination being outta whack.
  Stronger varieties of green are pretty lame they‚Äôre just included in 7 and 
  not a higher number for consistency‚Äôs sake.
  Muted varieties of red and green are cool. This is where we get into colours
  that are inoffensive/muted but somehow niche.
  Teal, being a combination of blue and green, becomes more niche by default, 
  but it‚Äôs still highly effective if you got the finesse to implement it well
  (and it works for you as mentioned at the end of number 6 on the list here)
  Orange is technically just brown and pink is technically just red, but their
  highly saturated varieties are distinct enough to deserve their own number. 
  Use with caution. Their muted varieties start getting into just muted red ie 
  pale trans pink and muted brown ie lighter treatments of leather, generally 
  follow the same ideas as number 8 on the list here.
  Yellow and purple are only at the bottom of the list because it‚Äôs coinflip
  which one of the two suits your complexion and undertone well. But once you
  figure out which of the two suits you best, go off queen. Similar ideas as 
  before where there are safe/inoffensive varieties of yellow and purple, then
  the high saturation ones, then the muted/low saturation ones.

Ultimately you can just say screw this guide and this numerical list/heirarchy,
but the point is to help trans fems early on in their transition. We‚Äôre building
a wardrobe in a shorter timespan, like if there‚Äôs no baseline knowledge of this 
colour theory from before transition, I think it‚Äôd be very helpful to buy 
colours based on generally having more of those listed in the early numbers than
the latter numbers and so on. Yellow/purple being the exception here, once you 
know which of the two work for you they probably can roughly belong in the same
rankings/frequency as their blue red green counterparts. That‚Äôs a lot, but I‚Äôm
confident in saying this is a comprehensive breakdown of colour in fashion at a
fundamental level.

## Section 4: Seasonality cont.

To wrap up seasonality in a context outside of colour, I‚Äôll keep it practical.
Personally I live in a place that gets as low as -20 Celsius in the wintertime
and as warm as +35 Celsius in the summer. Honestly this is just brutal for my
wallet, if there is not enough savings at a given time the solution is to just
buy gradually based on the season that‚Äôs approaching (but this has its own issue
where the stores know this and say have more coats on their shelves leading up
to winter and they‚Äôre more expensive than usual). As a rule of thumb I always
recommend thrifting when possible for budgetary and sustainability reasons 
(plus you‚Äôre more likely to find quirky stuff when thrifting), cold weather
stuff can be thrifted quite effectively as the items are inherently more 
rugged/long lasting. To improve versatility of seasonal items, it helps to go
for the aforementioned more versatile colours and to get simpler items (more on
this later). If this is still too much, at the end of the day we‚Äôre just trying
to get by. If there‚Äôs a more masc item in your wardrobe but it‚Äôs necessary for
being comfortable in the season and you can‚Äôt afford to buy femme equivalent(s)
for it, that‚Äôs ok. A wardrobe overhaul like this doesn‚Äôt happen overnight. If
you live in a place with less seasonal variance, lucky you lol

## Section 5: Formality and fashion niches

Big shake up now, we‚Äôre still in fashion fundamentals but it‚Äôs much less 
something we can think of in a vacuum. At the simplest level, in public there
are roles people present as, and I don‚Äôt mean gender roles. If you‚Äôre at a 
wedding, there is a role to play in terms of outfit, same can be said for a 
stuffy job, or on the other end in the streets of Shibuya or Paris outskirts or
LA, or a punk rock concert. In no situation does one actually have to follow 
these roles, but different situations may be more strict (ie workplace clothing
regulations, if you show up to a wedding at a tshirt the friend/family member
who invited you may feel very sad). If one does care about following this role,
I think it‚Äôs important to have the resources there so they can be followed more
clearly/confidently, so here we go.

By far the most important thing to do here is to simply observe your 
surroundings in different situations, and try to look for patterns in terms of
‚Äúrole‚Äù. As femmes, I‚Äôd imagine this also means focusing primarily on observing 
other femmes and what they‚Äôre wearing in different situations/roles. It is 
simply impossible for one guide to cover all these roles, as it‚Äôs effectively
endless once we factor in regional/national differences within each role and the
unique roles found in each country/region within a country. So there are two 
possible approaches which can maybe be mixed and matched. One is to hone in on
the majority audience that reads this, being American trans fems, and try to 
cover as many of the fashion niches/roles that are encountered by this
demographic. Alternatively, we can think of fashion niches/roles/levels of 
formality which are generally more universal and international. So this guide
will do a bit of both, and the different niches will be roughly listed in order
of formality. For the countless nets which I will not be able to cast, it‚Äôs
simply up to you as an individual to observe your surroundings and try and not
only imitate how femmes present in these situations, but also consider why it
works. This can be more advanced when thinking of colour coordination synergies
of different cuts waistlines tightness etc, hopefully by the end of the guide
these are more clear, but you can also just yknow ask them for help. These
fashion niche/style sections coming up are more explicit in terms of clothing
items, there are some basic items mentioned that cast a wide net across the 
style and hopefully can be used in other styles as well.

## Section 6: The ‚Äústyle‚Äù of CBA

The first niche here is that of CBA aka can‚Äôt be asked. Technically this is not
a basic fashion niche people formally categorize hence my funny naming 
convention, but it‚Äôs definitely there as its own fashion ecosystem. Very common
in most of the USA and fortunately common enough where I live as well to get 
away with it. Honestly, I struggle to call CBA a ‚Äústyle‚Äù or ‚Äúfashion niche‚Äù, 
it‚Äôs really more of a mindset. Fucking tired, can‚Äôt be asked to put together an
actual outfit, imma just slap some comfy shit on together. How far down the CBA
scale one get away with without being out of place depends on where you live. 
From my time living in the US, yeah you can get away with *a lot* in day-to-day
activity outside of work, and many workplaces you can get away with CBA outfits
as well. 

Shoes? Legit pick whatever comfortable sneaker you desire. If you‚Äôre in a 
position to buy a pair of sneakers, please consider colour here. Sneakers are 
often sold in some pretty bold colours, often with multiple colours together, 
you get the idea. If you don‚Äôt yet have a pair in black and a pair in white (or
more broadly lighter shades because let‚Äôs not kid ourselves a white sneaker 
don‚Äôt stay white for too long), next time you buy sneakers it ‚Äúshould‚Äù be one of
the two (or a black white combo, but even then one of the two will be the 
dominant colour). Technically you could wear a less comfortable shoe, but that
kinda goes against the whole can‚Äôt be asked mindset. Shoes which aren‚Äôt sneakers
can be comfy too, but generally the comfiest shoes in people‚Äôs wardrobes are 
their sneakers, hence the selection here.

Bottoms? Sweatpants and shorts is the start. This is also the first time we 
encounter this very simple concept, girl if you‚Äôre buying clothes please buy in
the women‚Äôs section. Sneakers are gender neutral, but with actual clothes how 
the fabric is sown and fit together varies in many minor and/or significant ways
with women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs sections. If you‚Äôre buying a pair of sweatpants, and you
buy men‚Äôs sweatpants over women‚Äôs you‚Äôre completely trolling and self-sabotaging
plain and simple. If you‚Äôre at the point where you‚Äôre still intimated by buying
clothes in the women‚Äôs section, well it‚Äôs a good thing online shopping is so
accessible. Buy from places with easy refund policies, but please keep in mind
that refund policies are not all they seem and often have insiduous consequences
for the environment. If you are super stressing/freaking out over shopping at
the women's section I get it I've been there, but the goal is to get to that
point one day, maybe going with a friend or two could help? Idk, the point is at
some point most people (accessibility concerns are why I only say most) will
take the plunge and shop in person. From here onwards, thisrule applies unless I
explicitly mention clothes gendering is not a factor for the specific item. If 
your legs are still fairly hairy and you don‚Äôt wanna show that, we‚Äôll go for the
pants. This also plays into the CBA mindset, cis women as well overwhelmingly go
for pants over shorts and skirts with CBA outfits because if someone can‚Äôt be 
bothered to put on a more formal/less comfy outfit there‚Äôs no shot they got the
time and energy to shave/groom their legs. Shorts and skirts are also less 
effective than pants for CBA because the tops are often pretty big in the 
literal sense and can overpower shorts and skirts. Other full coverage pants 
that you could use here include jeans trousers and leggings if they‚Äôre comfy 
enough for you. Jeans and carog pants are technically a step up from sweatpants
in terms of formality, but let‚Äôs be real here if we‚Äôre in the mindset of CBA 
this doesn‚Äôt really matter, as long as the contrast of formality isn‚Äôt too much.

Leggings are also something I need to give a massive disclaimer on (as much as I
know so many of us wanna wear them when we start out transitioning). There are
three main reasons why leggings are just difficult early on in transition. 
Firstly, finding one that fits is hard. Odds are as a trans woman you have 
longer legs on average, but also narrower than average at the start of 
transition when it comes (lack of) to fat there around booty and thighs, yet on
the other hand more muscular in some places because of testosterone even if you
weren‚Äôt too active. Since leggings are skintight, these starting differences 
from the average in our legs is a much more significant factor. Second, le 
bulge. With looser fitting, high waisted pants, it‚Äôs pretty damn easy to have 
the bulge not be visible. Or even with more fitted pants or shorts that have
chunkier fabric like solid denim or whatever cotton thingie goot cargo shorts
are made of, it's doable with just an ok tuck. That is obviously not an option
on leggings without some immaculate tucking. If you don‚Äôt have bottom/bulge
dysphoria that‚Äôs awesome I wish I was in the same boat, but I‚Äôd argue the 
majority do care and in cases of passing being needed for safety if presenting
femme in public this is obviously a huge deal. Tucking is annoying to say the
least, keep this in mind. There's also levels to tucking, ie just good tucking
shorts/panties where you don't necessarily have to yknow make the balls go up up
and away, then tucking with the up up and away, then tucking with tucking tape
for like revealing form-fitting swimwear. Third, even if the previous two 
factors are sorted out, leggings are just not flattering for the body type of 
the average baby trans fem. I‚Äôm exceedingly uncommon in the sense of having a 
well-defined hip to waist ratio even before hrt and not having the broadest
shoulders, but even still when I was like 1 year of hrt and had done plenty of
workouts for my lower half, an outfit with leggings did not look good on me with
few exceptions. The hip to shoulder ratio is just too much unless I was wearing
a similarly form-fitting top and even then it‚Äôs not a look I would consider good
right now let alone passing. Basically, the unfortunate reality is that leggins
are very difficult to work with unless a given trans fem is quite well developed
with fat redistribution and/or was an extremely anomaly of highrolling feminine
legs and waist pre-transition, and has had botton surgery on top of that. If
you‚Äôre still really stubborn about this or found a magical pair of well-fitting
leggings that is super comfy, there is one way to have it easily work out.

That being, tops which go well below the waistline. Oversized shirts and 
hoodies (I would opt for no zipper on hoodies here) are the go-to here, and 
luckily they‚Äôre a CBA staple. Comfy article of clothing that‚Äôs big enough to 
basically feel like a blanket? Sign me up! A cotton/crewneck sweater also works
here while being a CBA staple, it‚Äôs just hoodies without the hood. If you never
use the actual hood and don‚Äôt see aesthetic value in it, obviously go with 
sweaters lol.

Technically we can also go with tighter items in the realm of CBA, but this is 
rare regardless of what demographic is in the mindset and even more so with 
trans fems I‚Äôd wager. The main thing is that if factoring in passing, a well 
fitting top and bottom together is best kept as a no-go. So either a fit top 
loose bottom or loose top fit bottom (leggins in this case). But also plz be 
careful about the well fitting tops you get, it‚Äôs dangerously easy to 
overemphasize arms shoulders etc. This will also change a lot over time from
person to person depending on how breast growth occurs and/or any future breast
augmentations, one's proportions in terms of muscle around arms fat around belly
etc.

This is also a good time to mention where exactly the line between top and 
bottom is, we‚Äôre creeping into level 2 more than I‚Äôd like but oh well think it
fits well here. The answer is it depends, but should usually be different than
what you‚Äôre used to (aka roughly 50/50, around the furthest out edge of the hip 
bone). You can technically still do this and more importantly you probably still
have a lot of tops which cut off around this line, but if you care for passing
it helps to have the line either be around new/femme waist*, think a bit above
your belly button and right at or below the bottom of your ribcage, or have a 
top that goes far down enough roughly the other way around. So you can think of
it in 65/45s instead of 50/50 if that makes sense. I think one of these 65/45s 
is needed to make a more fitting top work for us early on, ie higher up pants
for a tighter top or a hoodie that falls well below hip line for leggings.

Last mention, crop tops. These work with a femme CBA outfit, but I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs
pretty tricky without first having an understanding of personal proportions aka
level 3 stuff. Would probably suggest holding off on it for now, but again if
the item makes you happy go for it. I just strongly recommend you also set it
with women‚Äôs fit bottoms (so you can do the 65/45 with the 65 being the bottoms)
not some men‚Äôs skinny jeans or whatever, we‚Äôre not trying to look like Gappy
here (shoutout to the 5 people who got this reference).

The overall message is CBA is supposed to be brain-off. This looks like an 
extremely limited set of items because it is, more items equals more thinking
which goes against the whole point. The upcoming category is also fairly simple,
but onwards it opens up *significantly* to the point that I can only mention a
few suggestions out of the ocean out there. Anyways onto:

## Section 7: Athleisure

Even if you really don‚Äôt follow the fashion stuffs and things before now you 
might have heard this term before. From my memory as a stupid egg kid, 
athleisure really started gaining traction around the mid-2010s when stuff like
ultraboosts were introduced and blew people‚Äôs minds while full synthetic tops
and sweatpants/leggings were pretty normal to just wear as everyday outfits. 
Since then athleisure has died down from being the mainstream everyday style in
the west to a respectable niche, which still serves its original function. That
being, make workout clothes cool. And yeah, sweatpants and athletic tops and
leggings and sports bras and all this stuff have gotten significantly more
presentable since athleisure got big.

Pretty simple application overall. Those nice sweatpants that fit well but not
too tight with cool zippers*, closer fitting zip-up sweaters/hoods which are
designed to be worn while exercising not to insulate heat and be soft*, cool
sports bras*, sneakers more explicitly meant for running with a smoother shape
to them*, hopefully you get the idea.

Here is also the introduction of trends. I am overall not a fan of trends
because yknow fashion industry propaganda where they reuse looks again and again
to increase profits, but athleisure has been a pretty organic instance of a
trend getting gigantic stock then falling off. These items were never really
meant to be a worn in an everyday/streetwear context etc, manufacturers were
mainly just making workout and athletic garments that don‚Äôt look like dogwater
and it took off. Then fairly quickly sellers made these pieces explicitly for 
athleisure settings, and for a while this was insanely profitable and popular. 
But eventually it died down and general looks which were more common before this
athleisure boom returned to being more common.

If you genuinely are a big fan of athleisure, go for it! If the motivation is
for figuring out fashion fundamentals however, I would advise explicitly looking
for athleisure pieces in the context of yknow exercise. If you‚Äôre buying workout
stuff and can afford ones which are nice enough to go onto CBA/the upcoming
section outfits, that‚Äôs great. But broadly speaking for people who aren‚Äôt 
intrinsically drawn to athleisure, that‚Äôs as far as I‚Äôd suggest taking it.

## Section 8: Streetwear

Ok this is the big one, which I will not nearly be able to sufficiently go over.
I honestly had a hard time determining what between colour and streetwear is 
more important to comprehensively explain here. Ultimately colour is still more
important because some people are in circumstances where streetwear is not
common (ie older in places/spaces where it is not the norm for upper ages to
wear streetwear, you‚Äôre either wearing work clothes or weekend date/night out
stuff and not much space for in between etc), but colour is always there.

But for the people who do fit into streetwear spaces, most likely the majority
of readers here, it‚Äôs a really big deal. Streetwear along with avant-garde 
(which will obviously not be covered in this guide) are the two big fashion 
clusters with the most diversity, expression, and skill ceiling to them. Unlike
avant-garde, streetwear has a fairly low skill floor. The skill floor being, go
outside in a trendier/young adult area local to you, see what people you read as
women are wearing, figure it out. 

Streetwear is basically whatever does not fall into an explicit sort of 
formality/work dress code, is not to the laziness levels of CBA, and is not
literal workout clothes. As it turns out, this is a lot of stuff, so the variety
of items which are commonly accessible that fall under streetwear is the 
highest. As dress code in the non-uniformed workplace has gotten less strict
overall worldwide, most people just default to streetwear or the next rung up
the formality scale (next category) or mixing the two together.

Within here most actual contemporary fashion niches worldwide lie. Punk*,
techwear*, normcore*, cottagecore*, 60s throwback*, roadman/gopnik*, lolita*, 
preppy*, walking logos*, you get the idea I hope. This might seem like 
overhyping but it‚Äôs really not, if you look in the right places streetwear is by
far the most accessible way to really express yourself with fashion, if that‚Äôs 
what you'reinterested in of course. And I really don‚Äôt think streetwear is an 
age thing either, when I was in Tokyo god damn some of those geezers were 
dripping out of their minds! What I brought up previously was purely the context
of fashion to fit in, if you wanna wear streetwear at whatever age you are, go 
for it!

But with that said, let‚Äôs actually think about streetwear in terms of items. 
I‚Äôll be going over items which were not included in the previous two sections,
which I‚Äôd deem the most ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù. But seriously, here more than any other
section take universal with a gigantic grain of salt. With streetwear you can
really go off the rails in the best way possible, there are so many different
forms of streetwear around the world, streetwear trends change so rapidly in 
comparison to other broad categories you have a lot of looks throughout the 
years to choose from, there‚Äôs no end to it. Of everything in level 1, getting a
grasp on streetwear fundamentals is toughest, especially since there‚Äôs not even
really too great of resources for women‚Äôs streetwear more broadly I can refer
everyone to. Have some fun along the way, streetwear is also by far the most
applicable of these categories to thrift shopping, there‚Äôs just so so much cool
stuff you can find which end up working in the right outfits or even defining
your wardrobe. That‚Äôs a concept which I will keep brief here, there should
eventually be some pieces you find so magical so high quality such a good match
for you they end up being staples of your wardrobe and even in some ways warping
your future purchases to meld around them.

Anyways hats. Now is a good time to talk about hats. Technically if it‚Äôs cold
enough you can/should be wearing hats with CBA and athleisure (which btw do fall
under streetwear as well but they had value in introducing independently), but
they‚Äôre generally extra work for CBA and fall off/go against the ‚Äúfunctionality‚Äù
of athleisure. Hats can be tricky, especially if you‚Äôre growing your hair out
for the first time (I‚Äôd imagine this is common for baby trans femmes). How hats
interact with short hair is fundamentally different than how they interact with
long hair. If you can pretty much fit all your hair into a hat it‚Äôs just gonna
flatten and/or compact it. If you have long hair it really depends, but 
generally the curlier one is the more of a dent it‚Äôll have. If your hair is so
straight hats leave basically no changes to your hair flow pattern, use this to
your advantage! If your hair is more voluminous, there are some ways of using
hats to really accentuate things and make both the hair and hat stand out. Hats
can also be situationally very good for keeping certain types of bangs 
safe/stable in windier days/situations where you gotta be more active, something
to keep in mind considering how bangs are the trans fem el classico.

In terms of what hats work in streetwear? Basically any hat as long as it‚Äôs not
too dainty/elaborate I‚Äôd say. So yeah, go off queen. Overall hats are extremely
underused in streetwear and fashion more broadly, but there‚Äôs really no reason
why regular usage of hats wouldn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm not telling everyone to go and buy
hats, but the point is to not be afraid of them. And streetwear is the most
forgiving place to starts when it comes to wearing hats, as is for most items of
clothing as long as it‚Äôs not too formal (but even then nobody‚Äôs gonna be judging
you for dressing more formal in a setting where most are casual/streetwear). The
main thing is just if you spend a lot of time on hair, hats might get in the way
(me if I grow my curly/wavy hair out), but then again you can spend time on your
hair with a hat style in mind. Worth considering.

Now the item everyone‚Äôs been waiting for, skirts. Disclaimer, I personally
almost never wear skirts, I have them but I just prefer this silhouette found
with pants. So yknow, don't feel pressured to have to included skirts in your
wardrobe, but of course I understand that it can be really fun to start messing
around with for the first time. In terms of the item itself, there‚Äôs two main
focuses and the rest is about how to incorporate a skirt intoan outfit. 1: get a
skirt that wraps around your new waistline*, probably a bit more on the tighter
side rather than looser if that makes sense since if you‚Äôre early in transition
your waist will likely get thinner with hrt and exercise if you choose to 
heavily invest there. 2: make sure the rest is not form-hugging. This is
important because we want the looseness of the rest of the skirt to create the
image of the wider hips/legs. But as with the leggings if you do have wider hips
then sure go for the pencil skirt. Also important because bulge and all that if
you care, and more particularly how different walks and posture on your end and
impacts of wind can affect le bulge visibility different from pants and shorts.
I would go into specifics about skirts past this but that‚Äôs not what level 1 is.

Why is this in the streetwear section? You can wear skirts in streetwear‚Ä¶ duh. 
This doesn‚Äôt mean all types of skirts though, you can think of it similarly to
pants, more formal slacks (usually) don‚Äôt work with streetwear or at least are
not as easy to execute. There are kinds of skirts that work better for
streetwear, and those which don‚Äôt. A pretty easy way or figuring this out is by
selections in stores. If a clothing store with a more streetwear presentation 
has skirts in it, their types are probably good with streetwear. Likewise if you
go to a store with a more office attire vibe then those skirts will likely not
work too well with what we normally think of with streetwear. With all that
being said, skirts are generally less common in streetwear (shorts and
especially pants are extremely dominant here), but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should
not wear skirts. You can easily wear skirts/an outfit in the following 
section(s) in a streetwear setting nobody‚Äôs stopping you. Despite what I
mentioned earlier about le bulge, skirts are valuable as a bottom where as long
as you get looser ones (which is most skirts fortunately) as long as you learn
skirt posture and movements, le bulge is hidden. So pants and skirts that are 
not too tight can arguably be the predominant types of bottoms for trans femmes
who don‚Äôt have srs either voluntarily or involuntarily. It is also worth noting
that some styles/fabrics/cuts of skirts work better for streetwear or are in
fact primarily made for streetwear, this is something you pick up on with time,
or in the simpler cases there are sometimes skirts you can find from designers
and/or brands which exclusively release streetwear stuff.

Ok next broad item, coats. When I think of coats the first thing that comes to
mind is pea coats, but the main takeaway is to think of this silhouette at a 
simple level. There are some very elaborate coats out there, but this is fashion
fundamentals so let‚Äôs keep it simpler. A good pea coat will straight up work in
every single setting from streetwear into weddings and funerals (well a black 
one for this in most places in the world but you get the idea). We can get 
thinner with the fabric if climates don‚Äôt fall down too low where you are, and 
if you‚Äôre living in a warmer climate well too bad hold this one L (sorry that
sounds mean, I'm just envious as someone who has to deal with winter). While I 
saythat it will work in every single setting, it is an inherently more reserved
garment. Room for experimentation is definitely there, but for beginners I would
say it‚Äôs good to keep it simple with other pieces in an outfit with a pea coat
as well, so like no prints maybe some fabric patterns in one item, thickness of
other pieces as previously mentioned can be either thick/very thin with thicker
pea coats or more intermediate fabric thickness with appropriately intermediate
coats.

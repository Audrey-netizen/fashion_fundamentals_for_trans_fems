## Earrings

I'll keep it simple, I think you are completely throwing the bag if you don't at
least get your ear lobes pierced. If you have immunodefficiency concerns or
something else I am forgetting sure that is fair enough, but otherwise I don't
really want to hear it. Yes it can be varying amounts of expensive depending on
where you live, please save up for it and you can start with very basic and
affordable studs (and in many parts of the world just getting earlobe piercings 
is quite cheap, you'd be surprised). Yes it can hurt, but at least the basic
earlobes are a fleshier part that doesn't hurt as much as getting piercings
elsewhere on your ear cartilage. If you don't already sleep on your back with
your head up, it would be good to practice that as it is effectively mandatory
early on when you get two-sided earlobe piercings.
